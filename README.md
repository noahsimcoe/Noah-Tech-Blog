Challenge 14

## Description
During this project I demonstrated my understanding of working on a back end. I proved that I know how to configure a working Express.js API and that I could use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. I also proved that I know how to enter schema and seed commands to populate fake data in my application's database.Regrading the API routes, I wrote GET, PUT, DELETE, and POST routes for the different tables of data on this application, and they can be tested in Insomnia to view their functionality.

## Installation
This project is NOT deployed on GitHub Pages, but installation and usage of the project can be viewed in the screencastify video linked at the end of the README file.

Some of the packages that are required though (to help connect your Express.js API to a MySQL database are [MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) and [Sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize), and the [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) package is to use environment variables to store sensitive data.

## Usage
This project is used as an example of what the back end of an application may look like. It can be used as a reference to see how Sequelize is used to connect to a MySQL database, it shows how tables/fake data are created and seeded on an application, and it provides a lot of examples of writted routes that follow the CRUD operations that can be used/tested in Insomnia for further learning.
